# AlgoVisualizer
An Open Source Algorithm Visualizer

## Abstract
As the need for virtual learning has increased, it has become a necessity in recent years. The way of teaching has changed, visual learning is given more 
importance than the traditional methods of teaching. Visualizing the concept being taught is one of the easiest ways to understand the concept. Also explaining
the concept becomes much easier when visual aid is used to explain the concept. In computer science, algorithms play an important role. The need for creative
problem solving, optimizing the existing solution, increasing the efficiency of creating new solutions, etc have increased in recent times, the basic 
requirements for these skills is a good understanding of algorithms. In this paper, the different types of algorithms explained via the use of visualization 
are path finding, sorting, dynamic and back tracking. The path finding algorithms can also be visualized with the help of a first person shooting game. For 
understanding the theory of the algorithms it provides a separate section which the user can access and navigate easily. A page dedicated to recent information
about developments in computer science and algorithms can be accessed by the user. A detailed explanation has been provided in the modules of the proposed 
system.

## Introduction
Visual learning has been superior since one’s childhood, as we know the first thing we learn as a kid is basically a scenario of a particular object or being.
Similarly, know-how algorithms are vital to laptop technological know-how. Even though algorithms can be understood using flow charts, artificial codes and 
actual programming language, the exceptional manner to recognize the functionality of algorithms is to visualize. Visualizing the set of rules affords a way
for human beings to recognize and consider the real functionality of the algorithms. Energetic visualization of the set of rules the use of the algorithm shows
is the exceptional manner to recognize the set of rules. A powerful visualization of a set of rules display algorithm helps to better understand the algorithm
of how the set of rules will work underneath distinctive situations consisting of enter quantity, complex set of rules used, and so on. In recent years, the 
want for eye touch has elevated. As online teaching has become a necessity inside the teaching enterprise these days, the field of laptop technology has a need
for a set of rules instructors. As a result, a visible algorithm visualizer is needed for teaching and knowledge algorithms. It now not only enables the scholar
to recognize the algorithms however additionally the instructor / expert in explaining the algorithms without problems and correctly.

## Proposed System
This undertaking consists of diverse rendering-primarily categorized algorithms which include good judgment-based renders and element-based renders, Which take
logic into account to discover paths and type facts that compare to each other.

Each rendering algorithm having numerous features of this platform:
- 2D Visualization.
- 3D Visualization (Virtual World).
- Theoretic Information.
- Manual mode (Visualize User’s Input data).
- Forum (Application in real world).

Aside from those, Judgment primarily based algorith s has extra characteristic i.e. “Co pare” (Use to evaluate their algorithms primarily based on real-time
pace of execution).

Current platform consists of following algorithm representation:

Considering different categories; lets understand each of them separately.

### Pathfinding:
A	path-finding categorized algorithm is a term typically utilized with graphs and tree data-structure which is used to identify the shortest available route
among nodes, which might be initially designed for travel maps and now used in inner gadget to break map information.
Computerized: Default mode in visualizer guides the user to understand the working for finding a path from source to the destination node with respect to 
obstacles generated on the way.

Manual: Manual mode contains various checkpoints initialized by a user in-order to get shortest possible route covering all the nodes

### Sorting
Data-sorting is an important task in this world, they need to be sorted as per generation, identification or other required sequence. However, sorting 
algorithms has been implemented by software engineers so that the system could provide better results in the shortest possible time these data are in 
terms of array queues, linked list or any other data-structure.
Computerized: Default mode on this visualizer will help a user to observe a work using a variety of algorithms and randomly generated data.

Manual: Manual mode helps a user to see working by sorting their own input-data using any method available in the options.

### Backtracking
The algorithms specifically built for solving the particular component. It determines the brute-force technique to answer a given problem-statement at almost
every possible value for a component.
Computerized: Default mode of a platform will automatically generate a problem inside which the component randomly visualizes every possible value updating
to get the final answer.

Manual: The user can customize a given component while creating their own problem-statement and the visualizer will solve it without changing the user value.

### Dynamic Programming
Introduced methods are the most optimal way to solve the problem-statement of an applied component. This method uses a previously generated solution to obtain
a new solution and store it with some data-structure to reuse it in future.
Computerized: Default mode generates its own problem-statement for a component specified by the user and also visualizes the storing and reusing the data
generated.

Manual: Users may add their own data to observe and understand the working of the most optimal solution for their problem statement.
